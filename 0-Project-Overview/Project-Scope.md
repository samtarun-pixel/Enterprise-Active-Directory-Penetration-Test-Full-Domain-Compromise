# Project Scope

This project represents an internal Active Directory security assessment performed against a custom-built enterprise environment.

The objective of this phase was to design a realistic corporate Active Directory domain, review its identity and access architecture, and identify inherent internal attack surfaces.

The assessment assumes an internal attacker scenario, such as a compromised employee workstation, and focuses on architectural weaknesses rather than zero-day exploitation.

This phase establishes the foundation for full internal penetration testing and domain compromise simulation.
