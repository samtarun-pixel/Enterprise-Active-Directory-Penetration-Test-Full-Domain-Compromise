# Enterprise Active Directory Security Assessment

This repository documents a professional internal security assessment of a custom-built enterprise Active Directory environment.

The project focuses on enterprise architecture, identity design, administrative trust relationships, and internal attack surface assessment, rather than solving prebuilt labs.

## Project Summary

- Designed and deployed a multi-host enterprise Active Directory environment from scratch
- Implemented realistic OU hierarchy, users, groups, and service accounts
- Modeled real-world enterprise attack surfaces such as Kerberos service exposure and privilege boundary weaknesses
- Documented findings in a professional internal security assessment report

## Environment Overview

**Domain:** corp.local  

**Key Systems:**
- DC01 – Domain Controller  
- FS01 – File Server  
- WEB01 – Web/Application Server  
- MGMT01 – Management Server  
- EMP01 – Employee Workstation  

## Assessment Scope

- Active Directory Domain Services
- DNS integrated with Active Directory
- Organizational Units and Group Policy
- Identity and access architecture
- Enterprise attack surface identification

## Deliverables

- Enterprise environment architecture documentation
- Internal attack surface assessment
- Professional security assessment report (PDF)
- Remediation recommendations

## Notes

This repository represents the architecture and assessment phase of an internal Active Directory penetration testing engagement.  
The environment is designed to support full exploitation and domain compromise simulation in future phases.
